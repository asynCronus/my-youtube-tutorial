# hashtag is a github shortcut to denote a Main Header

This is a practice file for me to do some hands on stuff and rememberb the git commands to be able to get a good grasp over git & github and moving files in these two.
This really is a whooo moment for me to be able to make this by actually understanding what im supposed to do and not do it blindly!!

Feeling like Columbus!! Successfully accessed my repo, cloned the README.md and now I will edit and push it back! woooo!!
