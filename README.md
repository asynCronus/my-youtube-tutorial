# hashtag is a github shortcut to denote a Main Header

This is a practice file for me to do some hands on stuff and rememberb the git commands to be able to get a good grasp over git & github and moving files in these two
This really is a whooo moment for me to be able to make this by actually understanding what im supposed to do and not do it blindly!!
